<p>In February 2015, we set out to build a bank that we’d be proud to call our own.
  We were 12 people with zero customers, temporarily camped out in the offices of
  our friends at White Bear Yard in London. We wanted to change the way people thought
  about their money.</p>
<p>Two years later, we’re serving almost 250,000 customers across the UK and people
  write to us everyday letting us know how we’ve helped give them back control of
  their finances.</p>
<div class="s_6846">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet s_0f6b" data-lang="en">

  </blockquote>
  <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>
<p>In time, we want Monzo to be a bank that improves the lives of a billion people around
  the world.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Last year</h3>
<p>We have had a fantastic year - our prepaid programme has just hit 240,000 funded
  accounts, with more than £250m spent in total.</p>
<p>The first five months of 2017 in particular have been very strong. Since January,
  we’ve seen an average of 5% weekly growth in customer numbers and 7% weekly growth
  in transaction volumes. This growth is almost entirely organic from word-of-mouth
  referrals as people tell their friends and family.</p>

<p>In February and March, we agreed £22.5m of investment from Passion Capital, Thrive,
  Orange Digital Ventures, and more than 6,500 Crowdcube investors. We have also
  now directly connected to both Faster Payments and Mastercard as members and in
  April of this year we received our full UK banking licence.</p>

<p>The foundations are now in place for us to launch full bank accounts.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">The next year</h3>

<p>We have two key priorities for the next six months.</p>

<p>First, we want to continue to grow our user base and ensure we can meet that level
  of demand operationally. </p>

<p>Delightful customer support has been a key pillar of our success so far. Even though
  we’re running a mobile-only bank, offering authentic human interaction is crucial
  to building and maintaining trust. Our customers should be able to talk with someone
  at Monzo about their money, at any time of night or day.</p>

<p>If we continue to grow at this rate, we will hit somewhere between 500,000 and 800,000
  accounts by the end of the year. To continue to offer the level of support we aim
  for, we will need to significantly expand our team; we’re looking to bring on around
  40 new customer operations staff in the next six months. </p>

<p>Our second priority is rolling out the current account. We believe people shouldn’t
  need to think about financial products. People didn’t sign up for Monzo because
  they were looking for a prepaid card; instead, they want immediate visibility and
  control of their money. The shift from prepaid card to current account, therefore,
  should be as seamless as possible for our customers. The current account will have
  all of the functionality of the existing prepaid card, but add on features like
  Direct Debits, Faster Payments and overdrafts.</p>

<p>We try to avoid “big bang” launches, instead preferring to roll-out new features
  iteratively. This reduces risk and ensures we can continue to offer people the
  level of service they’ve come to expect from Monzo. We have about fifty current
  accounts live today among our staff, and we’ll soon progress to a few thousand
  customers. At the moment, we’re aiming to offer the current account to all existing
  customers in late summer. The wait might be frustrating at times for our community,
  but it’s important to get it right. We have a responsibility to keep our customers'
  money safe.</p>

<p>From a financial perspective, we’ve got enough capital for at least the first 12
  months of life as a bank. To create a viable, sustainable business, it’s important
  that we reach profitability over time. However, profitability is not a key priority
  for this year, and we would prefer to focus on growth over driving revenue. As
  a consequence, and as explained in our crowdfunding pitch earlier this year, we’ll
  need to raise more funding in early 2018. If we grow even faster than expected,
  we may need to accelerate funding plans. We are also exploring ways to include
  a crowd component in the next investment round to include as many of our community
  as possible.</p>

<p>Having built direct connections into Mastercard and Faster Payments, our unit economics
  will improve dramatically once customers move to the current account. The prepaid
  scheme loses around £50 per active customer per year. Simply by moving to current
  accounts powered by our own technology, we plan to significantly reduce this amount.</p>

<p>The largest remaining costs are customer support and ATM usage. On customer support,
  we believe that we will be able to significantly improve efficiency in the long-term,
  so we’re prepared to over-invest in the short-term to provide our customers with
  a world-class experience.</p>

<p>Around 40% of the per-customer loss is due to international ATM usage outside the
  UK or EU, with a small minority of our user-base driving the majority of this cost.
  As a result, we will explore ways to reduce this cost in collaboration with our
  community – it will not be a profit-making exercise. UK and EU ATM usage costs
  us much less, and we aim to keep this free. We still believe foreign exchange at
  point-of-sale (in shops, restaurants and online) can be provided to customers for
  free.</p>

<p>On the revenue side, we will start experimenting with lending functionality. Roughly
  speaking, we aim to be in the cheapest quarter of the market on price (adjusted
  for factors like risk, customer profile, and the type of lending), but we do not
  aim to be price leaders in all circumstances. Nor do we wish to set a single headline
  price and compete as part of "best-buy” tables. Instead, we will focus on offering
  lending tools to to help people manage their day-to-day finances more effectively.
  We want to give people immediate visibility and control of their money, rather
  than tempting them in with a low headline price and then recouping costs elsewhere.</p>

<p>As a result, we will aim to run a number of quick, small-scale lending trials to
  better understand how people like to manage their money. When we’re confident these
  new product features work well for customers, we’ll roll them out more widely.
  You may start to see glimpses of new features or pricing that we’re trialling over
  the next few months!</p>

<h3 class="u-font-maison">Long-term</h3>

<p>In the long-term, we want to build a powerful financial control centre for a billion
  people. We don’t want to be a full-service bank, offering Monzo mortgages or Monzo
  credit cards. Instead, we want to be a platform or marketplace that gives people
  visibility and control of all of their money, whichever providers they use. The
  future of banking is data and identity.</p>

<p>Imagine if you could collect loyalty points simply by using your Monzo card to pay
  in shops. Or if your gas and electricity tariff was automatically switched to ensure
  you’re always getting the best deal. Imagine opening a new ISA with a couple of
  taps, investing all the money Monzo has helped you save. We are looking at early
  prototypes of these third-party integrations today and some are already pretty
  magical. We will aim to roll out a handful of these to our customers in the next
  12 months.</p>

<p>There are clearly potential risks and pitfalls here. Who gets to access customer
  data? What purposes can they use it for? Is it stored securely after it’s shared?
  These are questions we will need to address before these third-party services can
  be offered to all customers.</p>

<p>In principle, we believe the customer should be in control of their financial data.
  As such, we will explain what benefit you’ll get from sharing, and we won’t share
  your personal data with third parties without your explicit consent. We also believe
  in transparency – if Monzo benefits from a data-sharing deal, we’ll let you know
  about it upfront. If you don’t give consent, your data will remain private. We
  welcome new regulation (GDPR and PSD2 in particular) in this area because we believe
  it puts the customer firmly in control of their personal data.</p>

<p>We see ourselves as trusted custodians of both your money and your data. We will
  only succeed if we maintain that trust.</p>

<p>We’re incredibly excited about this year and the opportunities ahead of us. I’d like
  to thank the Monzo team, our investors, and the wider Monzo community who all have
  helped us get this far. Here’s to the next 12 months!</p>

    <h2 class="u-font-maison s_5ee1">Directors' report</h2>
<p>The directors present their report and financial statements for the 12 months ended 28 February 2017. These financial statements have been prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, rather than UK GAAP.
</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Results and dividends</h3>
<p>The loss for the year after taxation amounted to £6,689,000 (2016 – loss of £1,446,000). The directors do not recommend a final dividend (2016 – £nil).</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Principal activities</h3>
<p>The principal activity of Monzo Bank Limited (the “Bank” or the “Company”) is to provide retail banking services in the UK.
</p>
<p>During the period the Company continued the building of the capability to provide banking services to its customers and obtaining an unrestricted license to do so. It also launched a prepaid debit card in order to be able to use the lessons learned from
  this to build the best possible current account product for its customers.
</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Directors</h3>
<p>The directors who have held office during the year ended 28 February 2017 are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Baroness D Kingsmill (Chairman)</li>
  <li>T Blomfield</li>
  <li>T Brooke</li>
  <li>E Burbidge</li>
  <li>G Dolman (appointed 7 November 2016)</li>
  <li>M Grimshaw (appointed 21 February 2017)</li>
  <li>K Woollard (appointed 23 May 2016)</li>
  <li>A Kirk (appointed 24 January 2017)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="u-font-maison s_5ee1">Directors’ liabilities</h3>
<p>The Bank has indemnified all directors of the Bank against liability in respect of proceedings brought by third parties, subject to the conditions set out in the Companies Act 2006. Such qualifying third party indemnity provision was in force during the
  year.
</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Financial risk management</h3>
<p>The Directors’ assessment and approach to financial risk management are detailed in note 4 of these accounts.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Going concern</h3>
<p>Since incorporation the Company has undertaken a series of successful equity raisings to fund the start- up phase of the business. The initial focus of the Company was on obtaining a banking licence, which was received in August 2016 subject to restrictions.
  The restrictions were lifted in April 2017 and the Company can now launch its product in the market.
</p>
<p>To support this launch and subsequent-phases of its growth, the Company has raised sufficient equity to ensure that it can survive for a period in excess of 12 months from the end of the reporting period. Details of equity raised are contained in Note
  14. Consequently the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Events since the balance sheet date</h3>
<p>In March 2017 £2.5m was raised via the issue of 2.5m ordinary shares to investors.
</p>
<p>The restriction to maximum total deposits of £50,000 was lifted by the FCA and a full banking licence was granted in April 2017.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Appointment of auditors</h3>
<p>Ernst &amp; Young LLP were appointed as auditors of the Company on 28 February 2017 and have been re-appointed pursuant to section 487(2) of the Companies Act 2006 unless the members or directors resolve otherwise.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Employment of disabled persons</h3>
<p>The company does not discriminate against any person on the grounds of disability.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Disclosure of information to the auditor</h3>
<p>So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, being information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing its report, of which the auditor is unaware. Having made
  enquiries of fellow directors and the Company’s auditor, each director has taken all the steps that he is obliged to take as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that
  information.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Auditors</h3>
<p>In accordance with section 485 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution is to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting for reappointment of Ernst &amp; Young LLP as auditors.

    <h2 class="u-font-maison s_5ee1">Statement of directors' responsibilities</h2>
<p>
  The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors Report and the financial
  statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and those International
  Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.</p>
<p>Under Company Law the directors must not approve the financial statements
  unless they are satisfied that they present fairly the financial position, financial
  performance and cash flows of the company for that period. In preparing those financial
  statements the directors are required to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting Policies,
    Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then apply them consistently;</li>
  <li>present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant,
    reliable, comparable and understandable information;</li>
  <li>provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in
    IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular
    transactions, other events and conditions on the company's financial position
    and financial performance;</li>
  <li>state that the company has complied with IFRSs, subject to any material departures
    disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and</li>
  <li>make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.</li>
</ul>
<p>The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient
  to show and explain the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy
  at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that
  the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible
  for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps
  for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

    <h2 class="u-font-maison s_5ee1">Independent auditors' report</h2>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">to the members of Monzo Bank Limited (formerly Focus FS Limited)</h3>
<p>
  We have audited the financial statements of Monzo Bank Limited (formerly Focus FS
  Limited) for the 12 months ended 28 February 2017 which comprise the Statement
  of Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of
  Changes in Equity, the Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes 1 to 19. The
  financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable
  law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
  Union.
</p>
<p>This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in
  accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work
  has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters
  we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.
  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
  to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit
  work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor</h3>
<p>As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page
  9, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements
  and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility
  is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with
  applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those
  standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards
  for Auditors.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison s_5ee1">Scope of the audit of the financial statements</h3>
<p>An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
  statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
  are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes
  an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s
  circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
  reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the
  overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the
  financial and non-financial information in the Directors’ Report to identify material
  inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any
  apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications
  for our report.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Opinion on the financial statements</h3>
<p>In our opinion the financial statements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 12 months
    ended 28 February 2017 and of its loss for the year then ended;</li>
  <li>have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
    Union; and</li>
  <li>have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006</h3>
<p>In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which
    the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements;
    and
  </li>
  <li>the Board of Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable
    legal requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="u-font-maison s_5ee1">Matters on which we are required to report by exception</h3>
<p>In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Bank and its environment obtained
  in the course of the audit, we have identified no material misstatements in the
  Board of Directors’ Report. We have nothing to report in respect of the following
  matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit
    have not been received from branches not visited by us; or</li>
  <li>the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns;
    or
  </li>
  <li>certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
  </li>
  <li>we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

    <h2 class="u-font-maison s_5ee1">Notes to the financial statements</h2>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">at 28 February 2017</h3>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">1. Basis of preparation</h3>
<p>The accounts have been prepared on an historical cost basis and in accordance with
  International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European
  Union. The company prepared its financial statements under Financial Reporting
  Standards for Smaller Entities (‘FRSSE’) for the period from 18 February 2015 to
  29 February 2016. FRSSE differs in certain respects from IFRSs, hence certain disclosures
  have been amended to comply with IFRSs. There have been no material changes to
  the financial statement results or balance sheet position in either the current
  or previous period as a result of the change in accounting policy. The significant
  accounting policies adopted are set out in Note 3.
</p>
<p>The financial statements are presented in GBP, which is also the Company’s functional
  currency.
</p>
<p>Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are
  not mandatory for the 12 months ended 28 February 2017 and have not been early
  adopted by the company. In addition there are certain new standards that are not
  yet effective and may impact the Company in future periods. These include IFRS
  9, ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ and
  IFRS 16, ‘Leases’. These standards are expected to impact the Company, in particular
  IFRS 9 once banking operations have commenced, though a detailed analysis of the
  impact on the company has not yet been performed.
</p>
<p>The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with IFRS
  as issued by the IASB.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">2. Critical accounting estimates and judgments</h3>
<p>The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates
  and assumptions. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical
  experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are
  believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience
  may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
</p>
<p>Management considers that the accounting estimates relating to fair valuing stock
  based compensation (Note 15), and the recognition (or not) of deferred tax assets
  for carried forward tax losses (Note 3(g)) are the most material to the financial
  statements.
</p>
<h4 class="u-font-maison">Going concern</h4>
<p>Since incorporation the company has undertaken a series of successful equity raisings
  to fund the start- up phase of the business. The initial focus of the company was
  on obtaining a banking licence. A licence with restrictions was obtained in August
  2016 and the restrictions were lifted in April 2017. The focus of the company has
  been on further developing its customer proposition and building its operating
  model and infrastructure. The Company plans to launch its banking operations to
  customers in 2017. To support this launch, and subsequent-phases of its growth,
  the company has raised sufficient equity to ensure that it can survive for a period
  in excess of 12 months from the reporting date. However in order to support growth
  of the business it is expected that a further equity raise will be undertaken at
  the start of 2018. Given the success of previous equity raisings and the growth
  that is being experienced by Monzo we believe that there will be strong demand
  for that issue. Consequently the financial statements have been prepared on a going
  concern basis.
</p>
<h4 class="u-font-maison">Valuation of share options</h4>
<p>The Company measures the cost of equity-settled options based on the fair value
  of the awards granted. The fair value is determined based on the observable share
  prices or by using an appropriate valuation model. The use of option pricing models
  to determine the fair value requires the input of highly subjective assumptions
  including the expected price volatility, expected life of the award and dividend
  yield. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value
  estimates. The assumptions and models used for estimating the fair value of share-based
  payments is disclosed in note 15.
</p>
<h4 class="u-font-maison">Summary of significant accounting policies</h4>
<p>This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation
  of these financial statements to the extent they have not already been disclosed
  in the other notes above.
</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    <strong>Receivables</strong>
    <br> Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured
    at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cash and cash equivalents</strong>
    <br> For the purpose of presentation in the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and
    cash equivalents includes deposits held at call with financial institutions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Property, plant and equipment</strong></p>
    <p>Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly
    attributable to the cost of the assets.
    </p>
    <p>Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, and calculated using
      the straight-line method to allocate their cost, net of residual values, over their
      estimated useful lives, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>Office and IT Equipment – 3 years
    </p>
    <p>Fixtures and fittings – 4 years
    </p>
    <p>Office fit out costs and legal costs of acquiring a new office lease are recognised
      on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Intangible assets</strong></p>
    <p>Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated
    impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method, to
    allocate the depreciable amount of the assets to their residual values over their
    estimated useful lives as follows once brought into use:
    </p>
    <p>Third party software licences – amortised over the length of licence, which varies
      between 1 and 10 years.
    </p>
    <p>Amortisation is recorded within administrative expenses in the Statement of Comprehensive
      Income.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Trade and other payables</strong></p>
    <p>These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the
    company prior to the end of the financial period which are unpaid. The amounts
    are unsecured and usually paid within 30 days of recognition. Trade and other payables
    are presented as current liabilities. They are recognised initially at fair value
    and subsequently measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Current Taxation</strong></p>
    <p>Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured
    at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
    The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amounts are those that are enacted
    or substantively enacted, at the reporting date, when the Company generates taxable
    income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with
    respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation
    and establishes provisions where appropriate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Deferred tax</strong></p>
    <p>Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax
    bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
    Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted
    or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the
    related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability
    is settled.</p>
    <p>Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probably
      that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences
      can be utilised.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Share-based payments</strong></p>
    <p>Employees (including senior executives) may be entitled to receive remuneration
    in the form of share options to reward strong long-term business performance and
    to incentivise growth for the future.</p>
    <p>The cost of the employee services received in respect of the share options granted
      is recognised over the period that employees provide services. This is generally
      the period in which the award is granted or notified and the vesting date. The
      overall cost of the award is calculated using the number of shares and options
      expected to vest and the fair value of the options at the date of grant.
    </p>
    <p>The fair value of options at grant date is recognised as an employee expense with
      a corresponding increase in equity over the period that the employees become unconditionally
      entitled to the awards. The grant date fair value is determined using valuation
      models which take into account the terms and conditions attached to the awards.
      Inputs into the valuation model include the risk free rate and the expected volatility
      of the Company’s share price.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Revenue Recognition</strong></p>
    <p>At present the Company generates income from interchange and interest receivable.
    This is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits
    will flow to the Company and they can be reliably measured, which is consistent
    with the approach to be taken with revenue in future periods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Foreign exchange</strong></p>
    <p>The Bank’s financial statements are presented in GBP, which is the Bank's
    functional currency. That is the currency of the primary economic environment in
    which the Bank operates. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded
    at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary
    assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the
    functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences
    are taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Non-monetary items that are
    measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using
    the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items
    measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange
    rates at the date when the fair value is determined.</p>

<h3 class="u-font-maison">4. Risk Management</h3>
<p>At Monzo, we take the responsibility of being a bank very seriously and recognise
  that the firm is exposed to a number of risks through our chosen business model
  and business strategy. Identifying, assessing, managing and reporting on those
  risks is central to the way we run the Bank. Good risk management enables the creativity
  we seek to provide for the development of our bank and its technology.
</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Risk Management Framework</h3>
<p>Our approach to Risk Management supports the wider business strategy and is delivered
  through our Risk Management Framework which comprises 6 key components: Risk Appetite,
  Policies, a 3 Lines of Defence organisation structure, various risk procedures,
  tools and techniques, risk reporting and an appropriate governance structure.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Principal Risks</h3>
<p>Through our business strategy and business model we are exposed to a number of risks,
  the most material of which we have termed our principal risks and they are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strategic and Business Model Risk – risk or threats that materially affect the
    business strategy, business model and consequently the successful execution of
    the business plan.</li>
  <li>Customer Outcome Risk – risk that our culture, behaviours and/or actions result
    in poor customer outcome and/or detriment to customers through our product and
    services not meeting needs.</li>
  <li>Retail Credit Risk – risk that customers who borrow do not meet their obligations
    in accordance with the agreed terms.</li>
  <li>Operational Risk – risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from failed internal
    processes, people and systems and / or from external events.</li>
  <li>Financial Risk – various risks which impact the financial profile of the business
    including liquidity risk, interest rate risk and wholesale credit risk.
  </li>
  <li>Compliance Risk – risk of failure to meet with the relevant legislation and / or
    regulation.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="u-font-maison s_5ee1">Risk Profile</h3>
<p>During the year 2016/17 the business has been focused on a prepaid card programme
  with a number of partners to test a number of areas of the business model whilst
  building the infrastructure to launch a current account programme. The most significant
  risks are therefore the viability of the business model and the operational risks
  of running the prepaid programme.
</p>
<p>Financial crime, cyber security and operational process risk are the main exposures.
  There is very limited credit and financial risk in the prepaid card programme.
</p>
<p>As full banking operations commence the Company will be exposed to more significant
  risks and to the full range of risks described above.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">Governance</h3>
<p>Our governance structure has been developed to support our launch as a bank. It comprises
  a Board of Directors supported by 4 Board Committees each of which has membership
  drawn from the independent non-executives on the Board. The 4 committees are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Risk &amp; Compliance Committee</li>
  <li>Audit Committee</li>
  <li>Remuneration Committee</li>
  <li>Nomination Committee</li>
</ul>
<p>Day to day running of the business is delegated to the CEO who has established 2
  Management Committees to support him; an Executive Committee for general business
  matters and an Assets and Liability Committee on Balance Sheet matters.

<p>The UK Government has announced reductions in UK corporation tax to 17% by 1 April
  2020. The closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated taking
  into account that existing temporary differences may unwind in periods subject
  to the reduced rates. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of
  tax losses carried forward totalling £4,993,718 as there is insufficient evidence
  as to their recoverability.</p>

<p>Some of the shares in issue are owned by management and staff and are subject to
  time based vesting conditions. At the balance sheet date 10,636,554 shares were
  unvested. In the event of shares failing to vest the Company has the right to repurchase
  the shares at their nominal value.</p>
<p>At the balance sheet date 159,629 ordinary shares were subject to a monthly vesting
  programme and in accordance with IFRS 2 will be treated as Treasury shares whilst
  they remain unvested.</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">15. Share-based payments</h3>
<p>The company operates two share options scheme for the benefit of certain members
  of staff. The first is an HMRC approved Company Share Option scheme (‘CSOP’) in
  which awards can be made to employees subject to conditions. The strike price for
  these options is set according to the fair market share price at the time of issue
  as agreed with HMRC. For the Non-CSOP scheme, awards are made with the strike price
  set equal to the nominal value of the shares. For both schemes typically twenty
  five per cent of the options vest at the end of the first year of employment. The
  remainder vest evenly over the next three years. The fair value per share was based
  on the pricing achieved in the funding round immediately preceding the issuance
  given the shares are not actively traded. The total expense in 2017 was £294k (2016
  £14k).
</p>
<p>The main assumptions that have been used in deriving the value of the
  options at grant are;

<h3 class="u-font-maison">18. Country reporting disclosure</h3>
<p>In 2015, the UK Government enacted legislation (contained in the Financial Services
  and Markets Act 2000 Statutory Instrument 3118) with respect to country reporting
  disclosure. As the Company only operates in the UK this requirement has been considered
  and no further disclosure is required.
</p>
<h3 class="u-font-maison">19. Events after reporting date</h3>
<p>The Company raised £2.5m of equity share capital from existing and new investors
  during the period from 1 March 2017 to the date of signing the accounts.
</p>
<p>The restriction to maximum total deposits of £50,000 was lifted by the FCA and
  a full banking licence was granted in April 2017.</p>
