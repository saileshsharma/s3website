It's totally free and takes all the hassle out of the process because we do everything for you. You can use it to go Full Monzo and make us your main account, if you like. \n\nWeâ€™ll move your money and payments (like Direct Debits and standing orders) to Monzo, and close down your old account for you. We'll also tell your employer to move your salary to Monzo. This switch takes 7 days (or you can choose a date if you want it to happen later), and you'll need to make sure your old bank has the same address details we do before you start.\n\n\n\n"},"platforms":[{"id":"4da012a5-39d7-5ee6-b0ab-80548c592b01","platformId":"web"}]},{"id":"e122ea8b-cef5-56bd-ba39-237d643f5b58","slug":"overdraft-cass","question":"Can I switch to Monzo if I have an overdraft?","answer":{"answer":"Yes! You can switch using the Current Account Switch Service, even if you have an overdraft with your current bank. \n\nWe won't automatically give you the same overdraft limit that you had at your old bank. Head to your Account tab to check if you're eligible and see what limit we can give you. \n\nIf you're currently using your overdraft with your other bank, you'll need to agree a way to pay it back with them separately. They should get in touch to arrange sorting that out."},"platforms":[{"id":"4da012a5-39d7-5ee6-b0ab-80548c592b01","platformId":"web"},{"id":"c75a0f14-681b-5fed-a2ab-6cfd86829809","platformId":"ios_uk_retail"},{"id":"0ee91be9-8e39-58f8-891c-af7e27298481","platformId":"android_uk_retail"}]}]},{"id":"8377b1d0-b8d9-5faa-ba63-b384933e587e","displayName":"Why Monzo?","slug":"why-monzo","helpArticles":[{"id":"0b095ddd-339a-50d7-9780-7e1ecd6b228c","slug":"reasons-to-switch","question":"Reasons to switch to Monzo","answer":{"answer":"Sometimes a friend or family member might ask you why they should switch to Monzo, so we wrote this [handy blog post](https://monzo.com/blog/2019/01/30/tell-your-friends-to-sign-up/?utm_source=help&utm_medium=in-app \"Switching Blog Post\") with some reasons why! ðŸ˜Š"},"platforms":[{"id":"0ee91be9-8e39-58f8-891c-af7e27298481","platformId":"android_uk_retail"},{"id":"c75a0f14-681b-5fed-a2ab-6cfd86829809","platformId":"ios_uk_retail"},{"id":"4da012a5-39d7-5ee6-b0ab-80548c592b01","platformId":"web"}]}]}]},"allCategories":[{"slug":"business-accounts","displayName":"Business Accounts"},{"slug":"web-logging-in-to-the-app","displayName":"Logging in to the app"},{"slug":"monzo-with-friends","displayName":"Monzo with Friends"},{"slug":"emergencies","displayName":"Emergencies"},{"slug":"app-help","displayName":"App help and mobile payments"},{"slug":"budgeting-overdrafts-savings","displayName":"Budgeting, overdrafts and savings"},{"slug":"account-and-profile","displayName":"My Monzo account and profile"},{"slug":"monzo-plus","displayName":"Monzo Plus "},{"slug":"travelling","displayName":"Travelling with Monzo"},{"slug":"payments-getting-started","displayName":"Payments: Getting started"},{"slug":"switching-to-monzo","displayName":"Switching to Monzo"},{"slug":"payments-troubleshooting","displayName":"Payments: Troubleshooting"},{"slug":"legal-stuff","displayName":"The legal stuff"},{"slug":"joint-accounts","displayName":"Joint Accounts"},{"slug":"monzo-card-pin","displayName":"My Monzo Card and PIN"}]}}}
