We'd suggest:\n\n1. Deleting all the log in emails you've received from Monzo in the past, and request a new one. If you press the 'send magic link' button several times, it's likely that you're trying to log in using an expired link. \n\n2. Try accessing your email using alternative means. For example, if you're trying to tap the link using your phone's 'Mail' app, try using a web browser such as Chrome or Safari to access your email this way instead. \n\n3. If neither of the above options work, please contact us at help@monzo.com and we'll do our best to help!\n\n"},"platforms":[{"id":"4da012a5-39d7-5ee6-b0ab-80548c592b01","platformId":"web"},{"id":"c75a0f14-681b-5fed-a2ab-6cfd86829809","platformId":"ios_uk_retail"},{"id":"0ee91be9-8e39-58f8-891c-af7e27298481","platformId":"android_uk_retail"}]},{"id":"e4aedeaf-ba3a-5dd4-b1a0-674ebaa1f741","slug":"web-login-email-not-received","question":"I still haven't received a log in email","answer":{"answer":"Before contacting our support channels, we'd encourage you to:\n\n1.

Check your 'Spam' and 'Junk' folders to see if the link has been sent there.\n\n3. Double check that you entered the correct email address before requesting the link, and that you're searching the right inbox.\n\nIf the log in email still isn't appearing, please send us an email at help@monzo.com and we'll follow this up!

If you've got multiple emails, it can often be hard remembering which you used to sign up with. \n\n1. Search your 'Spam' and 'Junk' folders to see if we've emailed you before.
