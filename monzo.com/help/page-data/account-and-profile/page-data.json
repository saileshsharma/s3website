But bear in mind some cash machines will add a fee (which we don‚Äôt receive) for taking out money, so we recommend using machines that don‚Äôt charge.\n\nSome machines will also tell you that ‚ÄòYour issuer might charge you for this‚Äô, but you can ignore that message. We don‚Äôt charge for taking out cash in the UK.\n\n**__Paying by card abroad is always free__**\n\nWe don‚Äôt charge any fees for using your card wherever you are in the world. And if you choose to be billed in the local currency you‚Äôll get the best possible exchange rate, which is Mastercard‚Äôs standard rate with nothing added on top.\n\n**__We might charge a small fee for withdrawing cash abroad__**\n\nAt the moment, we charge a fee for withdrawing cash abroad in some situations. \n\nThe first ¬£200 in a rolling 30-day period is free, and after that we‚Äôll add a 3% charge to each withdrawal you make.\n\nYour limits are shared across any account you have, so if you have a joint account your allowance is across both of them.\n\nFor example if you take out ¬£150 on the 2nd of the month and ¬£45 on the 5th, your limits would reset on the 2nd and 5th day of the __next__ month. If you did a third withdrawal before those dates, then we'd charge the withdrawal fee."},"platforms":[{"id":"0ee91be9-8e39-58f8-891c-af7e27298481","platformId":"android_uk_retail"},{"id":"c75a0f14-681b-5fed-a2ab-6cfd86829809","platformId":"ios_uk_retail"},{"id":"4da012a5-39d7-5ee6-b0ab-80548c592b01","platformId":"web"}]},{"id":"e6b566ac-28e0-5803-a3f1-c8a25bde2b75","slug":"tax-status-us","question":"Finding my tax status - US","answer":{"answer":"Unfortunately we can‚Äôt advise you on your tax status.
