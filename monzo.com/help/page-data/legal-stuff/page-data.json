We believe this is more privacy friendly than using other identifiers. \n\nWe never send balance, transactions or any other sensitive information. We send events to Facebook to understand when people have installed the Monzo app or used key features. That way, we're able to advertise to the right people!  \n\nFor example, if you‚Äôre already our customer, you‚Äôre less likely to get unnecessary prompts to ‚Äúdownload the Monzo app‚Äù. This helps us reach potential customers far more effectively than randomly selected audience types (although this won‚Äôt prevent you from seeing Monzo advertising on Facebook entirely).\n "},"platforms":[{"id":"4da012a5-39d7-5ee6-b0ab-80548c592b01","platformId":"web"},{"id":"0ee91be9-8e39-58f8-891c-af7e27298481","platformId":"android_uk_retail"},{"id":"c75a0f14-681b-5fed-a2ab-6cfd86829809","platformId":"ios_uk_retail"}]},{"id":"822b5f9e-fd57-5e03-b779-01349619bd14","slug":"data-subject-access-request","question":"How can I get a copy of my data?","answer":{"answer":"You can ask for a copy of the information we hold about you by making a Data Subject Access Request.\n\nYou can do this either by [chatting with us](monzo://support_chat?from=button-help-article) or emailing [help@monzo.com](mailto://help@monzo.com).\n\nPlease let us know what type of information you're looking for, and we'll process your request once we've verified your identity.
