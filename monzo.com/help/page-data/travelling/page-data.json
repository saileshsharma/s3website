Instead, we'll tell you the local exchange rate when you arrive, and send you a spending summary of your trip when you get home.\n\n__Take a spare card üí≥__\n\nYour Monzo card should work anywhere that accepts Mastercard, but it might not work in some countries. Our [Community Forum](https://community.monzo.com/c/monzo/travelling/14) is the best place to ask questions about specific locations ‚Äì and there are lots of travel tips there, too.\n\n__We don't charge any fees for paying by card üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è__\n\nWe also don‚Äôt mark up the exchange rate, so you‚Äôre always getting the best possible deal. Some card machines ask if you want to pay in pounds instead, so make sure you pick the local currency for the best exchange rate.\n\n__You can take out up to ¬£200 from ATMs on a rolling 30-day basis üí∂__\n\nWithdrawals from an ATM are fee-free in the European Economic Area (EEA). For other countries, after the first ¬£200, we'll add a 3% charge to any money you take out. That's to cover our costs ‚Äì we don't make a profit from it.\n\nThe 30-day period resets exactly 30 days after your first withdrawal, rather than at the start of a new month.\n\nYour limits are shared across any accounts you have. So if you have a joint account, your allowance is split across that account and your personal account:\n\n- For example, if you take out ¬£150 on the 2nd of the month and ¬£50 on the 5th, your limits would reset on the 2nd and 5th day of the next month \n- If you made a third withdrawal before those dates, then we'd charge the withdrawal fee </br>\n\nYou can check your live withdrawal limits any time in your account:\n\n- Tap the __Home__ icon in the menu bar\n- Tap the __Account__ button under your Monzo card (if you can't find this button, swipe down on your list of payments)\n- Tap __Limits and allowances__\n- Look for __Fee-free outside EEA over 30 days__ </br>\n\n__Final tips on using ATMs abroad üèß__\n\n- Some ATMs will  charge you a fee for taking out cash (which we don‚Äôt receive), so we recommend using a free machine whenever you can.\n- You may need to [activate your magstripe](https://monzo.com/help/monzo-card-pin/what-is-magstripe) to use some foreign ATMs.\n- If an ATM or card machine asks which account you'd like to use, we suggest picking 'credit', as it's usually the most reliable. </br>\n\nHave a great trip üëã"},"platforms":[{"id":"0ee91be9-8e39-58f8-891c-af7e27298481","platformId":"android_uk_retail"},{"id":"c75a0f14-681b-5fed-a2ab-6cfd86829809","platformId":"ios_uk_retail"},{"id":"4da012a5-39d7-5ee6-b0ab-80548c592b01","platformId":"web"}]},{"id":"ef07e2b9-da69-5ba1-b0b6-6aa8bc8e232c","slug":"moving-abroad","question":"I‚Äôm moving abroad","answer":{"answer":"We can only offer accounts to UK residents at the moment, although we‚Äôd love to offer them to anyone in the future."},"platforms":[{"id":"0ee91be9-8e39-58f8-891c-af7e27298481","platformId":"android_uk_retail"},{"id":"c75a0f14-681b-5fed-a2ab-6cfd86829809","platformId":"ios_uk_retail"},{"id":"4da012a5-39d7-5ee6-b0ab-80548c592b01","platformId":"web"}]},{"id":"08915cfe-67e4-5a25-9cba-97805b7b2504","slug":"converting-balance-to-another-currency","question":"Converting my balance into another currency","answer":{"answer":"You can only have British pounds (GBP) in your Monzo account, so you can‚Äôt convert your balance into another currency. \n\nBut you can use your card abroad to make payments in any foreign currency.

That means that, unlike most banks, we don‚Äôt add a hidden percentage into the exchange rate. \n\nYou can see the current exchange rates in the Mastercard website using the link [here](https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/consumers/get-support/convert-currency.html \"Mastercard exchange rate\"). \n\nPlease enter bank fee 0.00% on that page. To guarantee you get the Mastercard exchange rate please always select to pay in local currency, like euros or dollars, instead of sterling.
