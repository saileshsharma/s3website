Your transactions will sync with FreeAgent/Xero every 24 hours, therefore if you have made transactions in the last 24 hours these will have changed your balance in your Monzo account but will not have yet been reflected in your FreeAgent/Xero account. If you head over to your \"Account\" tab and scroll down to \"Accounting Tools\" you should be able to see when the last sync happened\n2.
