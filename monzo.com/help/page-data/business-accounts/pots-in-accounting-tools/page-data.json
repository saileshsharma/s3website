Your transactions will sync with FreeAgent/Xero every 24 hours, therefore if you have made transactions in the last 24 hours these will have changed your balance in your Monzo account but will not have yet been reflected in your FreeAgent/Xero account. If you head over to your \"Account\" tab and scroll down to \"Accounting Tools\" you should be able to see when the last sync happened\n2. Since Pots aren't actually a separate account they won't display in your FreeAgent/Xero account as such. However what you will see is your total balance of your account. So if you have £1,000 in your main Monzo account and £500 stashed away in a Pot, your total balance is £1,500 and this is the balance you will see in your FreeAgent/Xero account. \n\nIf you think that your balance is still not right, and the above doesn't seem to explain the reason for us, you can contact us in the in app chat here."},"platforms":[{"id":"4da012a5-39d7-5ee6-b0ab-80548c592b01","platformId":"web"},{"id":"0ee91be9-8e39-58f8-891c-af7e27298481","platformId":"android_uk_retail"},{"id":"c75a0f14-681b-5fed-a2ab-6cfd86829809","platformId":"ios_uk_retail"}]}]}}}
