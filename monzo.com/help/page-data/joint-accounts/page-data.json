For example you can:¬†\n\n- Make payments and use contactless\n\n- Pay in your salary\n\n- Use Apple or Google Pay\n\n- Make Monzo-to-Monzo Payment\n\nAt the moment the app can't support a joint overdraft or Monzo.me payments. We'll be developing the joint account over the coming weeks, so it shouldn't be too long before we support some of this functionality. In the meanwhile, we're open to hearing your feedback.
