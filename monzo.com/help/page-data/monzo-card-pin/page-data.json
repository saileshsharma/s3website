The first time you use it, you'll need to pay by Chip and PIN, but after that you can use your card to make online and contactless payments as well.\n\nIn some countries they use magnetic stripe, or 'Magstripe', payments when they swipe your card. You can pay this way with your Monzo card, but we keep the option switched off by default because Magstripe payments aren't as safe. \n\nTo switch them on temporarily, head to the \"Account\" tab in your app, then select the 'Manage' icon underneath your card üòä\n\n\n\n"},"platforms":[{"id":"4da012a5-39d7-5ee6-b0ab-80548c592b01","platformId":"web"}]},{"id":"e4774d2c-c65f-5d9c-a937-7b9c9fe66881","slug":"does-support-3dsecure","question":"Does my Monzo card support 3DSecure?","answer":{"answer":"Yes, we do!
