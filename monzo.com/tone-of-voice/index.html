  <p class="u-color-grey-blue-dark u-font-size-h3">Hello! 👋</p>
  <p class="u-color-grey-blue-dark u-font-size-h3">
    Welcome to Monzo’s tone of voice guide.
  </p>
  <p class="u-color-grey-blue-dark u-font-size-h3">
    This is a (fairly) brief overview of how we write. It’s for everyone
    in every team, and it applies to all the writing we do, inside and out.
  </p>
  <p class="u-color-grey-blue-dark u-font-size-h3">
    We’ve opened this up to the world as well (hello world! 🌍), because
    we want to be held up to the lofty standards we set ourselves here. We
    believe in everything we’ve said, so if you see us falling short then
    please let us know.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2 class="u-font-maison" id="every-word-matters">Every word matters 📖</h2>
  <p>
    The words we put on screen and paper are one of the most important ways we
    have of showing people what we stand for. Not just our marketing, but all
    our terms and conditions, every chat with us, all the nooks and crannies in
    our app, and how we communicate with each other on the inside. Every word
    adds up to people’s perception of who we are.
  </p>
  <p>
    And if the way we communicate confuses, frustrates or scares them, we can
    lose their hard-earned trust in seconds. It’s especially important
    when we’re dealing with sensitive subjects, difficult topics or
    technical stuff. Those are the moments of truth when people will decide if
    we’re really transparent, and if we really have their best interests
    at heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    So every word matters. Every word is a chance for us to make a connection
    with someone, go beyond what they’d expect from a bank and brighten
    their day. (If that sounds unrealistic, check out some of the customer
    feedback we get to see the difference we make when we get it right.)
  </p>
  <h2 class="u-font-maison" id="this-isnt-a-set-of-rules">
    This isn’t a set of rules 📜
  </h2>
  <p>
    Good writing is empathetic. Thinking carefully about the people you’re
    writing to, and understanding how they feel and what they need from us,
    shouldn’t feel like a tick-box exercise – it should be something you
    put thought into every time. So if you’ve got a really good reason to
    veer off the path we’ve put here, go for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plus, we don’t want everyone to write like a bunch of drones. Monzo
    writing should have a family feel, like you can tell it’s come from
    people with the same values, but it shouldn’t feel like one person.
    Because it’s not, and that’s a bit weird.
  </p>
  <p>
    You’re here because you’re smart, caring, thoughtful people. We
    trust you to do the right thing to help our users (and each other).

    <h4 class="o-card__title" id="audience-language-a-brief-history-of-professional-english">
      A brief history of ‘professional’ English
    </h4>
    <p>
      The Romans arrived in Britain a couple of thousand years ago, and brought
      Latin with them. Local tribal leaders had to learn Latin, or else. So they
      did, and Latin became the language of religion and administration —
      which is why the words ‘religion’ and
      ‘administration’ come from Latin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after the Romans left, that Latin stuck around. The top of society
      used it as a way to separate themselves from the common folk who
      couldn’t understand it. It was a way of saying: ‘We know
      something you don’t.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Latin seeped into the foundations of legal writing (there’s still a
      lot of it there today). And legal writing became the basis of all business
      writing, because writing was time-consuming and difficult at first, and
      you only bothered to write something down if it was important — like
      a contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what we traditionally think of as professional language is essentially
      words that have a Latin root. Words we’d almost never say out loud,
      but which we write when we’re trying to sound business-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what we’re unconsciously doing is perpetuating that idea that
      ‘we know something you don’t’. But rather than making us
      sound smarter or more ‘professional’, it makes us sound cold
      and distant.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="u-font-maison" id="use-more-verbs">
    Use more verbs and fewer nouns
  </h3>
  <p>
    When we’re writing, we tend to swap out verbs for nouns. That’s because
    nouns are seen as fancier and more professional. Verbs are action or doing
    words, like ‘decide’ or ‘analyse’. And nouns are naming words, like
    ‘decision’ or ‘analysis’.
  </p>
  <div class="o-card o-card--anecdote">
    <h4 class="o-card__title" id="several-types-of-nouns">
      There are several types of nouns
    </h4>
    <p>But the two main types are common nouns and proper nouns.</p>
    <p>
      Common nouns name people, places and things, like ‘town’ or ‘boy’. We
      don’t capitalise them unless they start a sentence. Proper nouns are the
      names of specific people, places and things, like ‘England’ or ‘William
      Shakespeare’. And we should always capitalise them.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    We naturally use more verbs than nouns when we talk, because language is all
    about doing things. So we should do that when we write as well. See how it
    makes our writing shorter, too?

    The psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker has an idea called ‘the
    curse of knowledge’.
  </p>
  <p>
    He says that the more expert you are in something technical, and the more
    you’re surrounded by experts in the same thing, the harder it is to
    bridge the gap to what non-expert people can understand. You know it inside
    out, so you assume too much knowledge on behalf of other people.
    That’s something we can all fall victim to — so watch out!
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep an eye out for terminology that we use all the time, but which might
    not quite be clear to people outside Monzo (or even new people just starting
    out here).
  </p>
  <p>
    When we say ‘terminal’ do we mean ‘card machine’?
    When we say ‘funds’ do we mean ‘money’? When we say
    ‘reversal’ do we mean ‘refund’? And if not, do we
    explain why?
  </p>
  <p>
    We can’t get around the fact that sometimes we have to use technical
    language, and that some terms have nuanced meanings (like
    ‘refund’ versus ‘reversal’). But we can always be
    precise about exactly what we mean, and help out people who aren’t
    familiar with the subject.

      When you buy something in a shop or take out cash, the merchant asks us to
      create an 'authorisation', which is when we update your balance in your
      app — but the money hasn't actually moved yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases the merchant will then send a follow up message to collect
      the money (called a ‘presentment’) based on that
      authorisation. This can take up to a week but usually happens within 48
      hours. This is when banks have always updated statements, and why it can
      take a few days for transactions to appear in traditional bank statements.

      Serious isn’t the same as formal
    </h4>
    <p>
      Sometimes we worry that writing clearly and simply can mean we lose
      authority, especially when we’re dealing with serious topics.
      That’s largely because of how business English has developed, and
      it’s just what we’re used to. When companies get serious,
      their language gets formal. It’s how you know this is A Big Deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it doesn’t have to be that way. Being serious isn’t the
      same as being formal. That’s the crucial difference between content
      (what we say) and tone (how we say it).
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2010, US attorney Sean Flammer ran an experiment. He asked 800 circuit
      court judges to side with either a traditional ‘legalese’
      argument, or one in what he called ‘plain English’.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judges overwhelmingly preferred the plain English version (66% to
      34%), and that preference held no matter their age or background.
      Here’s an interesting extract from Flammer’s findings:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The results indicate that the participants found the Legalese passage
        to be less persuasive than the Plain English version. The respondents
        also believed the Plain English author was more believable, better
        educated, and worked for a prestigious law firm.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      So it’s not just about credibility. Explaining yourself clearly
      makes you look smart, too 💅

    Start with what matters to readers
  </h3>
  <p>
    Put yourself in your reader’s shoes when you’re writing; what
    are they going to be most interested in? We’re often tempted to
    explain why we’ve done something before we tell people what the thing
    actually is — especially if it’s bad news or an uncomfortable message.
    But if your first question is what does my reader really need to know, then
    you can’t go wrong. Are they more interested in the process we took to
    decide something, or how that decision affects them? (Hint: it’s
    almost always the latter.) That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t
    explain our reasons, it just means we should explain what the impact is
    first. (And once you’ve decided what your key messages are?
    Subheadings are your best friend.)
  </p>
  <h3 class="u-font-maison" id="ambitious-stay-positive">Stay positive</h3>
  <p>
    We believe in our mission, and we should be proud of what we’re doing.
    Big up people’s achievements and generally spread the love.
  </p>
  <p>
    But as much as we want to be the best bank in the world, we don’t want
    to get there by putting anyone else down. It’s not the Monzo way to
    call out flaws, or to attack what anyone else is doing.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s also important to remember that we wouldn’t get anywhere
    without the support of the people who trust us to look after their money.
    Everything we do is for them, and they deserve a share of the credit
    whenever we celebrate our successes.

    Let positivity ring through in your writing. The odd exclamation mark or
    confetti emoji is great! 🎉 But if we use them in every other sentence, they
    start to feel a bit forced and insincere.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same goes for superlative words like ‘great’,
    ‘lovely’ and ‘awesome’. Sprinkled over our words
    they brighten everything up. But if we use them all the time, they start to
    lose their power. (If everything’s awesome, then is anything really
    awesome? 🤔)

    There’s a funny thing that happens to our writing when we’re
    giving bad news, or talking about processes. We slip into what’s
    called the ‘passive’ voice, which basically means we don’t
    say who’s responsible for something.
  </p>
  <p>Like this:</p>
  <blockquote class="o-card">
    A decision has been made to close your account
  </blockquote>
  <p>That’s not great for readers for a couple of reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Firstly, it looks like we’re avoiding responsibility. We decided to
      do it, so the fair thing is to own that decision. From their point of
      view, we could look a bit shifty otherwise.
    </li>
    <li>
      Second, it’s ambiguous — we haven’t actually said who made
      that decision. Was it us? Was it our regulators? There’s a chance
      someone won’t know, and we’re creating a problem for them that
      doesn’t need to exist.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here’s the ‘active’ version:</p>
  <blockquote class="o-card">
    We’ve decided to close your account
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    (This could also be ‘I’ve decided to close your account’,
    depending on the situation. The crucial thing is that we explain who’s
    responsible.)
  </p>
  <p>Here are a couple more examples:</p>
  <blockquote class="o-card">
    <p>Passive: This bug will be fixed in the next update.</p>
    <p>Active: We’ll fix this bug in the next update.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote class="o-card">
    <p>
      Passive: If you make a complaint, it will be escalated to a complaint
      specialist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Active: If you make a complaint, we’ll escalate it to a complaint
      specialist.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    We use the passive voice partly because we’re unconsciously distancing
    ourselves from the message. If we’re closing someone’s account,
    that’s not a nice message to give, and we take ourselves out of the
    equation.
  </p>
  <p>
    But that’s not fair for the reader, and what they need should always
    come first.
  </p>
  <p>
    There might be rare occasions where we deliberately don’t want to say
    who’s responsible for something, but we usually slip into the passive
    by accident — it’s not a conscious decision. So we’re not saying
    never use it, but make sure you’ve got a really good reason for using
    it if you do.

    <p>
      Add ‘...by monkeys’ to the end of any phrase you think might

    Trust in subheadings, they’re your best friend
  </h3>
  <p>
    We’re a species of skim readers. We’ve got more to read than any
    humans in history, on smaller and smaller screens, with less and less time
    to do it. So as writers one of our toughest jobs is just to hold
    people’s attention.
  </p>
  <p>That’s where subheadings come in 😍</p>
  <h4 class="u-font-maison" id="transparent-trust-in-subheadings-theyre-your-best-friend-subheadings-give-you-the-gist-fast">
    Subheadings give you the gist, fast
  </h4>
  <p>
    Scroll through this guide, and you’ll (hopefully) be able to
    understand the big idea in each section just by reading the headings. Then
    if you want the detail, you can dig in.
  </p>
  <h4 class="u-font-maison" id="transparent-trust-in-subheadings-theyre-your-best-friend-the-best-headings-are-more-than-labels-or-questions">
    The best headings are more than labels or questions
  </h4>
  <p>
    A heading like ‘Subheadings’ doesn’t tell you anything on
    its own. Neither does one like ‘What do I need to know about
    subheadings?’ The trick with subheadings is to summarise the essence
    of what you’re trying to say in one line, and then save the detail for
    the bit below. It’s tricky, but your readers will thank you for the
    effort. Even if they only look at the subheadings, they’ll still know
    the key stuff.

  <p>
    Don’t be afraid of a few subheadings in an email, or a customer
    response. It’s pretty unlikely that anyone will say: ‘Sorry,
    could you make this longer and more complicated please?’

      Behavioural economics alert: subheadings help with ‘fast
      thinking’ 👟
    </h4>
    <p>
      Behavioural economist Daniel Kahnemann has a theory called ‘fast and
      slow thinking’. And there’s a link to language that fits in
      nicely here. In brief:
    </p>
    <p>
      You can’t help answering a sum like ‘2 + 2’ in your head
      because it’s so simple. It promotes fast thinking, which
      doesn’t take much effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas you probably won’t even try to solve ‘1604 x
      7803’ unless you’re a math superstar. Because it looks like
      more effort from the outset, it promotes slow thinking and you’re
      less likely to engage with it.
    </p>
    <p>How does that link to language?</p>
    <p>
      Big long dense blocks of text make you feel sad inside before you even get
      started. They’re the linguistic equivalent of a difficult sum.
      (Think how you react to a page of A4 writing without any spaces in it...)
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas speeding down a list of short, sharp headings is a breeze, so
      you’re more likely to stay engaged and pay attention. Subheadings
      (and simple language) promote fast thinking because they make it easy for
      readers.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="u-font-maison" id="transparent-make-bullet-points-work-for-you">
    Make bullet points work for you
  </h3>

  <p>
    Our advice on bullet points is pretty simple. Big lists of bullets are no
    easier to read than big blocks of text. So they should be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>no more than a (short) sentence</li>
    <li>consistent in style</li>
    <li>related to each other</li>
    <li>under 6 per list.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you find yourself writing marathon lists of bullets, think about whether
    you can group them into themes under different subheadings. And if your
    bullet starts to stretch into more than one sentence, then you might be
    dealing with a paragraph with a dot next to it.
  </p>

  <h3 class="u-font-maison">Try to keep your sentences under 20 words</h3>
  <p>
    Why? Because we’re all human and we’re all busy. Shorter sentences are
    easier for people to scan and quickly get the information they need. Plus,
    they’re more accessible for people who struggle with reading or have a
    cognitive disability, like dyslexia.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://strainindex.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/longer-the-sentence-greater-the-strain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studies</a>
    show that 11-word sentences are considered easy to read, and those of 21
    words are fairly difficult.
    <a href="http://comprehension.prsa.org/?p=217" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a>
    also shows that when your average sentence length is 14 words, people
    understand over 90% of it. But at 43 words, people understand under 10% 🤯
  </p>
  <h4 class="u-font-maison">
    Default to what you’d say out loud
  </h4>
  <p>
    The trick isn't to sit there counting every word you write. We vary the
    length of our sentences when we talk. So you'll see where you'd naturally
    pause or take a breath when you read it out loud. Reflecting that in our
    writing makes us sound more human, and helps with rhythm too.

  <h2 class="u-font-maison">
    We’re open, inclusive and welcoming to everyone
  </h2>
  <h3 class="u-font-maison" id="open-be-open-and-inclusive">
    Be open and inclusive
  </h3>
  <p>
    Monzo is a welcoming community no matter who you are. That means we’re
    inclusive in our language too. We can, and should, change our language to be
    more inclusive of <strong>everyone</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Obviously there’s no place for anything racist, sexist or derogatory,
    but it goes beyond that too.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, it’s pretty common to address a group of people as
    ‘guys’, even if there are women in the group — but we think
    ‘hey folks’, ‘hello everyone’ or ‘hey
    y’all’ is more inclusive.
  </p>
  <p>
    We think about all the different meanings or associations words might have
    when we use them. In our technical work we use ‘allowlist’ and ‘blocklist’
    instead of ‘whitelist’ and ‘blacklist.’ That’s because of the origin of
    these terms, with white being seen as ‘good’ and black being seen as ‘bad.’
  </p>
  <h3 class="u-font-maison" id="">
    We explain ideas as clearly as we can
  </h3>
  <p>
    Colloquial expressions (like ‘ain’t’ and ‘gonna’) and idioms (like ‘the
    elephant in the room’) might be harder for people from different cultures,
    or people with English as a second language, to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    So if there's a clearer way to explain an idea, that’s what we should use.
    And if someone uses a word or phrase you're not familiar with, it’s best to
    ask them to explain! You'll be helping them learn to be more inclusive in
    their communication, and helping any other people reading or listening who
    might also be struggling to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with everything else in this guide, if you’re being thoughtful and
    compassionate then you won’t go wrong.
  </p>
  <div class="o-card o-card--anecdote">
    <h4 class="o-card__title" id="open-be-open-and-inclusive-labels-matter-more-than-you-think">
      Labels matter more than you think
    </h4>
    <p>
      It might seem pedantic to care about whether we say ‘guys’ or
      ‘folks’, but how we label things really matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psychologist Lera Boroditsky ran an experiment in 2009 that makes this
      point really well.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told two groups of people that they were in charge of solving the
      problem of crime in the fictional city of Addison. The scenarios were
      identical in every way except one: she told one group that crime was
      ‘preying on the city like a beast’, and the other group that
      crime was ‘spreading through the city like a virus’.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group who were given the beast ‘frame’ were much more
      likely to propose things like more police and tougher sentencing. The
      group with the virus frame were much more likely to suggest social reform
      and education.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter how she rejigged the experiment, with groups based on
      people’s gender, background, age or political persuasion, the beast
      and virus frames were the biggest factor in influencing how they
      responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re much more susceptible to this kind of ‘framing’
      than we realise. And the labels we choose for things are often signals of
      biases we might not know we have. So being more thoughtful about the
      terminology we use is a great way to uncover and overcome them, as well as
      making sure we don’t accidentally upset or offend anyone.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="u-font-maison" id="open-we-love-emoji-💌">We love emoji 💌</h3>
  <p>
    Emojis set us apart and reflect what we’re like as people: colourful,
    friendly and open to new ideas. So feel free to use them, but please bear a
    couple of things in mind.
  </p>
  <h4 class="u-font-maison" id="open-we-love-emoji-use-emojis-to-add-context-not-replace-words">
    Use emojis to add context, not replace words
  </h4>
  <p>
    Emojis are best when they add a little extra flavour to what we’re
    saying. They help clarify what we mean, and let our personality shine
    through. (And research suggests they make for more effective communication.)
  </p>
  <p>
    But not everyone will know what they mean, so please don’t use them to
    replace words. We risk confusing people if they pop up in the middle of a
    sentence. Some screen readers also struggle with emojis, which means we
    might make things tougher for visually impaired people if we’re not
    careful.
  </p>
  <h4 class="u-font-maison" id="open-we-love-emoji-think-about-the-situation-youre-using-them-in">
    Think about the situation you’re using them in
  </h4>
  <p>
    Lots of people are using emojis, but they’re still by no means
    universal. And they can provoke a strong reaction if we’re not
    sensitive to our audience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best rule of thumb if you’re speaking directly to someone is to
    reflect what they’re doing. If their writing is emoji-tastic, then
    feel free to be the same. But if they’re not using any, or if
    you’re talking about a particularly sensitive subject or giving bad
    news, it might not be the best place for emojis.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re writing something for a more general audience, the same rule
    applies: think about how people will feel getting this news, and which
    emojis (if any) will help get the right message across.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with all of these guidelines, use your own judgement. If you’re
    always thinking carefully about how people will feel, you’re on the
    right track. 👍
