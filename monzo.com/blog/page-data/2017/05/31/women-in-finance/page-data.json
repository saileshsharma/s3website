Jayne-Anne Gadhia, CEO of Virgin Money, led a [review](https://uk.virginmoney.com/virgin/assets/pdf/Virgin-Money-Empowering-Productivity-Report.pdf) which focussed on strategies to improve gender balance, particularly in senior management, and HM Treasury launched this voluntary charter for financial services firms who would like to pledge to implement the four key recommendations from the report.\n \nAt Monzo we are building a bank that provides our users with the best possible banking experience. We can only serve our users well if we understand them, and part of that is having a team that represents multiple perspectives and a diversity of backgrounds. We’ve [written before](https://monzo.com/blog/2017/03/09/diversity-and-inclusion/) about the business benefits we have already seen from the diversity that exists within our team, and improving the gender diversity in our leadership team will contribute further to this."},"name":{"en-GB":"We've signed the Women in Finance Charter - 0"}}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-entry-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Our commitment","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"heading-3"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"By signing the Charter, we commit to doing the following:","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Having one member of the senior executive team who is responsible and accountable for gender diversity and inclusion.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"list-item"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Setting internal targets for gender diversity in senior management.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"list-item"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Publishing our progress annually against these targets in reports on our website.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"list-item"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Ensuring any variable pay for the senior executive team is linked to delivery against our gender diversity targets.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"list-item"}],"nodeType":"unordered-list"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"In setting our targets for gender diversity, we have focussed on our Board and our Executive Committee.
