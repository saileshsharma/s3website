We've explained how it works below:\n\n__If you go over your agreed overdraft limit__\nWe’ll reject any payments that take you over your limit, and you won’t be able to take cash out. The only exceptions are ‘offline’ payments, like those you make to TfL. We can’t reject these, so you’ll go into an unarranged overdraft, but we'll tell you as soon as this happens. You'll have until midnight to add money to your account, so you can avoid charges or any impact on your credit score (which might make it harder for you to borrow in the future). \n\nIf you go into an unarranged overdraft we’ll charge you the same rate we would if you were using your arranged overdraft, and we will cap the charges at £15.50 per month, so you will never pay more than that.  \n\n__If you don’t have an arranged overdraft__\nIf your account is empty, we’ll reject payments unless they’re payments as described above.
