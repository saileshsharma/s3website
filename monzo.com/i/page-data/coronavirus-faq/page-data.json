Remote working has always been a big part of working for Monzo, so we’re very used to it. \n\nWe’ve got multiple teams working on how we respond to this pandemic, so we can quickly adapt to changing circumstances and keep supporting all our customers. \n\n\n### Repaying and borrowing money\n\n__If you’re worried about repaying your loan or overdraft, please let us know__\n\nWhether you’ve been affected financially by coronavirus or not, if you’re worried about keeping up with your loan or overdraft repayments, or something’s changed in your circumstances, you should __always let us know.__ \n\nPlease chat to us in the app to discuss how best we can help – there are a range of ways we can support you. We know how difficult it can be to ask for help, but we care and we’re here to listen and help however we can. \n\n\n__We’re unable to offer emergency loans and overdrafts, including for small businesses__\n\nThat includes the government's Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS). But we're looking into ways we can support small businesses and we'll share an update as soon as we know more.\n\nWe’ve put together some useful places you can turn to for help with essentials at the bottom of this page.\n\n\n\n### Managing your account\n\n__Getting a friend or family member to manage your account if you’re sick__\n\nIf you need someone to help you manage your account, chat to us in the app to talk through the option that’s best for you. Whether you want to send spending notifications to someone you trust, or if you need more formal help managing your money, we can help. \n\n\n__You can still pay in cheques, but they might take longer to reach us__\n\nFrom 19 March, [Royal Mail](https://www.royalmail.com/coronavirus?iid=HP_M1_CORONAVIRUS) standard post, including Freepost, will take longer to arrive. Royal Mail are prioritising items posted by special delivery, but they’re not guaranteed to arrive by 1pm the next working day.\n\nIf it’s urgent, we recommend sending your cheque by Royal Mail’s ‘Special Delivery Guaranteed by 9am’ service, which is still guaranteed. Once we’ve got your cheque, it takes 4 working days to put the money in your account. \n\nIf anything changes, we'll let you know on our [blog.](http://monzo.com/blog)\n\n\n__Claiming back money on flights or events you can’t attend__\n\nIf something you’ve booked has been cancelled by the merchant you bought it from because of coronavirus, clarify the refund policy with them directly. If you decide not to travel or go to an event, it may be harder to get a refund. Depending on the circumstances, we might be able to help get you a refund, and we’ve summarised your options [here](https://monzo.com/blog/plans-cancelled-because-of-coronavirus-find-out-if-you-can-get-your-money). \n\n__Using cash__\n\nIn keeping with [government advice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-food-businesses/guidance-for-food-businesses-on-coronavirus-covid-19), many retailers are limiting the use of cash and asking people to pay by card if possible. Please be mindful of this when withdrawing cash - as it may be easier for you to pay using contactless during this time.\n\nThe contactless payment limit [has been increased from £30 to £45.](https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/press/press-releases/contactless-limit-uk-be-increased-45) although this may take some time to roll-out across all retailers.\n\n\n### Your savings\n\n__The money in your Savings Pots is safe__\n\nEach provider you open a Savings Pot with has its own FSCS (Financial Services Compensation Scheme) protection of up to £85,000.\n\nThe FSCS apply this limit to each person and to the total amount of money you have with the provider, whether held through Monzo or not. This means if you have separate accounts with our savings providers outside of the Monzo app, then the money you have in those accounts also counts towards the limit of £85,000.\n\n\n__Coronavirus doesn’t affect adding or withdrawing money from your Savings Pots__\n\nThe money you put in your Savings Pot is held by the provider you signed up with. So as usual, we need to allow some time to move the money back into your Monzo account. We'll do this before 5pm, the next working day. \nWith Fixed Term Savings Pots, the money can only be released on the date you originally agreed when you opened the Pot. \n\nIf you’re in financial difficulty and need the money sooner, providers might be able to release your money early. But we’ll need to ask for evidence to show your circumstances and then send them a request. We won't charge any sort of penalty fee if you need to withdraw money early from your Savings Pots.\n\nISA transfers are normally completed within 15 working days. But there may be a delay of a couple of days at the moment, due to Royal Mail running a reduced postal service. \n\n\n\n### Getting help if you’re worried about coronavirus and your money\n\nCoronavirus is affecting lots of people’s income and employment, as well as the ability to manage their money. We’ve summarised some different places to go for support and advice.\n\nThe [Money Advice Service](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/coronavirus-what-it-means-for-you) also offers free and impartial support. They have a dedicated page on [coronavirus and your money](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/coronavirus-and-your-money) that might help you assess your financial situation.\n\n\n__Benefits and daily living expenses__\nIf you're unsure of what benefits you are entitled you could try using the [Turn2Us benefits calculator](https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/AboutYou).\n\nFor emergency food, the [Trussel Trust](https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/emergency-food/) might be able to help you. It’s also worth checking with your local job centre, GP, and the Citizens Advice Bureau as sources of food vouchers too.\n\nFor emergency utilities this page from [Stepchange](https://www.stepchange.org/debt-info/gas-and-electricity-arrears.aspx) is a good place to start. \nFind out more about how your energy supplier can support you if you are encountering financial difficulties due to coronavirus [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-agrees-measures-with-energy-industry-to-support-vulnerable-people-through-covid-19).\n\n\n__Carers__\nCarers UK has useful guides for working carers on requesting flexible working and taking time off for sickness or self isolation [here](https://www.carersuk.org/help-and-advice/health/looking-after-your-health/coronavirus-covid-19) and [here](https://www.carersuk.org/help-and-advice/work-and-career). \nThe Government will be publishing specific advice for carers soon.\n\n\n__Freelancers and contract workers__\n[This page](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-credit-advances) will help you if you need an advance on your universal credit.\n\n[This page](https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay/what-youll-get) has all you need to know about statutory sick pay\n\nIf you’re a freelancer you can find updates and helpful advice from the IPSE (The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed) on their [coronavirus blog post](https://www.ipse.co.uk/ipse-news/news-listing/coronavirus-ipse-activity-and-advice-freelancers.html).\n"}}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-entry-block"},{"data":{"target":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ro61k101ee59","contentful_id":"ro61k101ee59"}},"id":"c1lDvG1Ytg5q29oXFbug23J","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-03-19T14:38:01.052Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-19T14:38:05.065Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment","contentful_id":"master"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"cmsSectionBlogRoll","contentful_id":"cmsSectionBlogRoll"}},"contentful_id":"1lDvG1Ytg5q29oXFbug23J"},"fields":{"internalTitle":{"en-GB":"Coronavirus Blog Roll"},"category":{"en-GB":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ro61k101ee59","contentful_id":"ro61k101ee59"}},"id":"c63CzaijYIYzUKkQVMDkOMl","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-03-19T11:27:33.490Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-19T11:27:33.490Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment","contentful_id":"master"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"blogCategory","contentful_id":"blogCategory"}},"contentful_id":"63CzaijYIYzUKkQVMDkOMl"},"fields":{"categoryName":{"en-GB":"coronavirus"}}}},"numRows":{"en-GB":1}}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-entry-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"canonicalURL":"/coronavirus-faq","theme":"default"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"542527c1-2e75-5cc9-8288-4de6d361283b","siteUrl":"https://monzo.com"}}}
